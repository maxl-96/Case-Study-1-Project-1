### Problem definition

The first step in determining if machine learning could benefit your business is to align the problem you're trying to solve with a machine learning solution.

There are three types of machine learning:
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unspuervised Learning
 - Reinforement Learning

When ML can be used, it falls under one of these types:
- Classification (Preditcts Classes)
- Regression     (Predicts a Number)
- Recommendation (Predicts the best Matches)


### Data

What kind of Data do i have? 
- Structured Data like rows and Columns?
- Unstructured Data like text or images
- Static Data - never changing Data
- Streaming Data - constantly updated data

### Evaluation

How am I able to mess my ML model? There are some different metrics for every ML problem.

### Features

The next step is to understand what features does my dataset provide and how can i use them?

### Modelling

Modelling is divided into three parts, choosing a model, improving a model, comparing it with others.

### Experimentation

The last step is to repeat all previous steps and test it again in a different way. When testing it again you can choost another model or hyperparameter and also some other features. 
Finally, compare all the models. 

## Getting Started

### Problem definition
Goal: The main goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not (binary classification) based on certain features (like age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.). This would help healthcare providers to assess risk and intervene earlier, potentially preventing heart disease.
