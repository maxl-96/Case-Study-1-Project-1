> How would you approach the problem?

There are 6 ML Steps as u can see in de image belo

 - Problem definition
 - Data
 - Evaluation
 - Features
 - Modelling
 - Experiments

## Problem definition

For solving a machinge learning problem, it is nessesery to understand the business problem. If u unterstand what problem u have u can choose the right ML type.

There are these types of machine learning:
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unspuervised Learning
 - Reinforement Learning

If ML can be used, its fall under one of therse three typers:
- Classification (Preditct Classes)
- Regression     (Predict a Number)
- Recommendation (Predict the best Matches)


## Data

What kind of Data do i have? 
- Structured Data like rows and Colums?
- Unstructured Data like text or images
- Static Data - never changing Data
- Streaming Data - constantly updated data

## Evaluation

How can i mess my ML model? There are some different metrics for every ML problem.

## Features

The next step is to understand what features do i have in the dataset and how can i use them?

## Modelling

Modelling breaks into three parts, choosing a model, improving a model, comparing it with others.

## Experimentation

The last step is to repeat all other steps and test some different ways. Choose other models or hyperparameter maybe some other features.
Then compare the models.
