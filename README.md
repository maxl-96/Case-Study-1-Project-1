## Case Study 1 Project 1 - Churn for Bank Customers
### ML Workflow

> How would you approach the problem?

The problem consist of 6 six ML steps that you can see in the image below:

<details>
<summary>Problem definition</summary>
<br>
The first step in determining if machine learning could benefit your business is to align the problem you're trying to solve with a machine learning solution.

There are three types of machine learning:
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unspuervised Learning
 - Reinforement Learning

When ML can be used, it falls under one of these types:
- Classification (Preditcts Classes)
- Regression     (Predicts a Number)
- Recommendation (Predicts the best Matches)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Data</summary>
<br>
What kind of Data do i have? 

- Structured Data like rows and Columns?
- Unstructured Data like text or images
- Static Data - never changing Data
- Streaming Data - constantly updated data
</details>

<details>
<summary>Evaluation</summary>
<br>
How am I able to mess my ML model? There are some different metrics for every ML problem.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Features</summary>
<br>
The next step is to understand what features does my dataset provide and how can i use them?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Modelling</summary>
<br>
Modelling is divided into three parts, choosing a model, improving a model, comparing it with others.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Experimentation</summary>
<br>
The last step is to repeat all previous steps and test it again in a different way. When testing it again you can choost another model or hyperparameter and also some other features. 
Finally, compare all the models.

## Getting Started

I will use VS Code with Jupyter Notebook. All packages u can find in the `requirements.txt`

The first step is to create and activate virtual environment
```shell
python -m venv .
source ./Scripts/activate (bash)
.\Scripts\activate        (powershell)
```
