## Case Study 1 Project 1 - Churn for Bank Customers
### ML Workflow

> How would you approach the problem?

The problem consist of 6 six ML steps that you can see in the image below:

<details>
<summary>Problem definition</summary>
<br>
The first step in determining if machine learning could benefit your business is to align the problem you're trying to solve with a machine learning solution.

There are three types of machine learning:
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unspuervised Learning
 - Reinforement Learning

When ML can be used, it falls under one of these types:
- Classification (Preditcts Classes)
- Regression     (Predicts a Number)
- Recommendation (Predicts the best Matches)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Data</summary>
<br>
What kind of Data do i have? 

- Structured Data like rows and Columns?
- Unstructured Data like text or images
- Static Data - never changing Data
- Streaming Data - constantly updated data
</details>

<details>
<summary>Evaluation</summary>
<br>
How am I able to mess my ML model? There are some different metrics for every ML problem.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Features</summary>
<br>
The next step is to understand what features does my dataset provide and how can i use them?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Modelling</summary>
<br>
Modelling is divided into three parts, choosing a model, improving a model, comparing it with others.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Experimentation</summary>
<br>
The last step is to repeat all previous steps and test it again in a different way. When testing it again you can choost another model or hyperparameter and also some other features. 
Finally, compare all the models.

## Getting Started

I will use VS Code with Jupyter Notebook. All packages u can find in the `requirements.txt`

The first step is to create and activate virtual environment
```shell
python -m venv .
source ./Scripts/activate (bash)
.\Scripts\activate        (powershell)
```

### Problem definition

The main goal of this project is to predict whether a customer has left the company or not --> 2 desicions --> binary classification

The model will be trained with patient data and labels. So we use supervised learning. It’s important to remember this prediction isn’t certain. It comes back as a probability. Maybe its better to get the probabilty of leaving a customer. 

> How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model?

Customer churn is a common challenge that businesses must address, making it a key priority.

Also known as attrition, customer churn refers to the level of inactivity or disengagement observed over a specific time period. By analyzing behavioral or relational data, businesses can often identify early warning signs. Recognizing the main factors behind churn and identifying customers at risk are essential for improving business growth and strategy.

### Data

We get the Data from the python package ucimlrepo

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.

The data are struktured and in this case the data are static and not changing. 


```python
# This code is provided on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo  
  
# fetch dataset 
heart_disease = fetch_ucirepo(id=45) 
  
# data (as pandas dataframes) 
X = heart_disease.data.features 
y = heart_disease.data.targets 
  
# variable information 
print(heart_disease.variables)
```
<details>
<summary>See Variables</summary>
<br>

- CustomerId — contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
- Surname — the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
- CreditScore — can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
- Geography — a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
- Gender — it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
- Age — this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
- Tenure — refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
- Balance — also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
- NumOfProducts — refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
- HasCrCard — denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
- IsActiveMember — active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
- EstimatedSalary — as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
- Exited — whether or not the customer left the bank.
</details>

### Evaluation

Now we define what defines success.

For a classification problem there are accuray and precion/recall (confusion matrix) important.

Probabilistic classification models are a better choice in healthcare settings because they provide more nuanced and actionable information, ensuring that the patient’s care is based on the full spectrum of risk and uncertainty, rather than binary predictions.

### Features and EDA

The next step is to understand the data and preparing the data.
You can see this step in `...ipy`

<h3>Neccessary Files for Release Notes</h3>

<details>

<summary>releaseNotes.md</summary>
<br>
<p>Add your own Release Notes by creating a `releaseNotes.md` File. [Optional]</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>.github/release.yml.</summary>
<br>
<p>You can Label your Pull Requests and Strukture them in this file. (for auto genenerating Release Notes)</p>

```yaml

    labels:
      - ignore-for-release
    authors:

```
</details>


<h2>Prepare a new Release</h2>

<h3>First Step - Choose new Version Number</h3>

<p>Your Application is ready for a new Release. Some Bugs are fixed and/or new functions are added. Push your main Branch and promote this build. Choose your version number. The default version bump is "patch". By adding the environment varibale "increment" with the value "Major" or "Minor" you overwrite the patch release.</p>
<p>The Version Number is defined as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH<br>

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,<br>
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and<br>
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</p>

<h3>Secound Step - Promote your Build in Drone from the Main Branch</h3>

<p>This will create a new branch called release-{version} e.g. release-4.2.7 and increase the version number. The new Release-Branch and the Main-Branch will be pushed in the repo.</p>

<details><summary>For Major and Minor Releases add an env Variable !! Important !! Click add</summary>
  <a align="left" target="_blank">
  <img width="400" src="https://github.deere.com/MPS/NETStandard-lib/blob/main/images/promote.png"></a>
</details>

<h3>Third Step - Last Changes</h3>

<p>If necessary pull the new Release-Branch and make a git checkout.
You can prepare some last Changes for the new Release. 
After that push the new branch. [Optional]</p>

<h3>Fourth Step - Create Release</h3>

<p>If the Build was successfull you can make a Promote in Drone from the Release-Branch.
This will create a Nuget Package and a Github Release.</p>


<h1 align="center">Important Pipelinesteps</h1>

<h2>Code Coverage</h2>

<p>Add Package References (coverlet.collector) in your !! TEST !! .csproj</p>

```c#
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="3.1.0">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>
```

The Argument `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage` on `dotnet test` creates a the Coverage Report.
The Drone Pipeline installs the Tool dotnet-reportgenerator and
converts the Report in a userfriendly Coverage File. For including Coverage History look the script `getCoverageHistory.sh` and `generateCodeCoverage.sh`

<details>
<summary>Example Coverage File</summary>
<br>
  <a align="left" target="_blank">
  <img width="100%" src="https://github.deere.com/MPS/NETStandard-lib/blob/main/images/Coverage.png"></a>
</details>

<h2>Task Create Nuget Package</h2>

<p>This commands will create your Package.</p>

```yaml
dotnet pack $PROJECT_PATH --configuration $CONFIGURATION --output $NUGET_PKG_PATH/

dotnet nuget push $NUGET_PKG_PATH/*.nupkg --source https://github.deere.com/_registry/nuget/MPS/index.json -k $API_KEY --skip-duplicate
```

<p>You only have to add your RepositoryUrl in your .csproj and choose your Package Name + Description.</p>

```c#
  <PropertyGroup>
    <RepositoryUrl>https://github.deere.com/{ORG}/{REPO}</RepositoryUrl>
    <PackageId>[PackageDescription]</PackageId>
    <PackageDescription>[PackageDescription]</PackageDescription>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

<h2>Task GitHub Release</h2>

The Script `ghApiRelease.sh` will create a GH Release with GitHub REST API.

```shell
./ghApiRelease.sh $API_KEY $path_to_assets
```

<p>The Script requires the Personal Access Token and the path to your asset files.</p>

<h3>Generate Release Notes</h3>

<p>There are two ways how you can add your Release Notes. Use both of them or choose your favorite</p>

<b>Automatically generate Release Notes</b>
<br><br>
For this task you need a config file in `.github/release.yml`
Now you can mark your pull_requests with labels and structure them in the config file. You can set "generate_release_notes": false in `ghApiRelease.sh`.
