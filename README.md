## Problem definition

For solving a machinge learning problem, it is nessesery to understand the business problem. If u unterstand what problem u have u can choose the right ML type.

There are these types of machine learning:
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unspuervised Learning
 - Reinforement Learning

If ML can be used, its fall under one of therse three typers:
- Classification (Preditct Classes)
- Regression     (Predict a Number)
- Recommendation (Predict the best Matches)


## Data

What kind of Data do i have? 
- Structured Data like rows and Colums?
- Unstructured Data like text or images
- Static Data - never changing Data
- Streaming Data - constantly updated data

## Evaluation
