## Getting Started

### Problem definition
Goal: The main goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not (binary classification) based on certain features (like age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.). This would help healthcare providers to assess risk and intervene earlier, potentially preventing heart disease.
